 * Helper class used with {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} to handle disposing of an object safely on

 * done to prevent blocking the garbage collection thread if a closure operation is blocking.

 * provided on the fly after initializing this object, although if you plan to do so, then you
 * should use a concurrent-safe collection type to prevent the risk of thread-safety issues.
