 * Interface for a {@link JctFileManager} configurer.

 * during creation.
 *
 * <p>The configurer itself must return a {@link JctFileManager} instance. This will usually
 * be the same value that is passed in the input parameter, as most configurers will only
 * want to mutate an existing file manager. Configurers may instead opt to return a different
 * file manager as the result, enabling wrapping the input in proxies or delegating
 * implementations.
 *
 * <p>Configurers may also decide to not run at all by marking themselves as being disabled,
 * which will result in them being skipped by any configurer chain or file manager that
 * respects this attribute.
