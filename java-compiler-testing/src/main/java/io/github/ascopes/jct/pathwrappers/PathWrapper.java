/**
 * A path-like object that can provide a {@link Path Java NIO Path}.
 *
 * <p>Not only does this enable us to have different types of path with varying behaviour, but
 * we can also use this to enforce that other references related to the internal path are kept alive
 * for as long as the path-like object itself is kept alive.
 *
 * <p>This becomes very useful for {@link RamDirectory}, which keeps a RAM-based
 * {@link FileSystem} alive until it is garbage collected, or the {@link RamDirectory#close()}
 * operation is called. The mechanism enables cleaning up of resources implicitly without
 * resource-tidying logic polluting the user's test cases.
