/**
 * A collection representing a chain of configurers to apply to a file manager.
 *
 * <p>This is used to provide a set of ordered configuration operations to perform on newly
 * created file managers to prepare them for consumption in test cases. Common operations
 * may include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Automatically configuring the annotation processor paths;</li>
 *   <li>Creating empty locations to prevent compilers raising exceptions;</li>
 *   <li>Installing logging interceptors.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When configuring a file manager with this chain, each configurer is invoked in the
 * provided order. Configurers themselves must return a file manager as a result of the
 * configure operation. This operation may return the input file manager if the operation
 * mutated the input, or it may return a different file manager instance. In the latter
 * case, subsequent configuration operations internally will use the new file manager.
 * The last returned file manager in the chain will be used as the final returned result.
 * This enables configurers to wrap file managers in proxies or delegating implementations
 * to intercept or override existing behaviours.
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe.
