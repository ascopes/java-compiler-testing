/**
 * Temporary file system location that can be created by users to store sources, inputs, and outputs
 * for compilation within.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses a temporary directory provided by the default file system on the
 * platform you are using, and is thus compatible with older IO-based facilities such as
 * {@link java.io.File}, {@link java.io.FileInputStream}, etc.
 *
 * <p>The downside to this is that if the JVM crashes, the directory may not be deleted. It may
 * also be slower than {@link RamDirectory}, and does not provide isolation from the environment
 * that the tests are running in.
