# Security Policy

This software is designed to be used as part of testing flows
rather than as a production-facing system. Therefore, most
exploitable security issues that could occur will not have
significant impact. However, should an issue be identified, I
will strive to fix these issues as soon as possible.

Fixes will be released as a new version, built from the most
recent `main` branch. Unless expressly requested, no attempt
to backport changes will be made.

Given this library is designed for use in test packs, the main
design assumption is that the software is being used by a
trusted user in a semi-trusted environment.
