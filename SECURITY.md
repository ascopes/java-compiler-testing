# Security Policy

This software is designed to be used as part of testing flows
rather than as a production-facing system. Therefore, most
exploitable security issues that could occur will not have
significant impact. However, should an issue be identified, I
will strive to fix these issues as soon as possible.

Fixes will be released as a new version, built from the most
recent `main` branch for Java 17. Support will not automatically
be provided for v5 or v4 versions of the library, but can be
requested if necessary via an issue.

Given this library is designed for use in test packs, the main
design assumption is that the software is being used by a
trusted user in a semi-trusted environment.
